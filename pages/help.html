        Welcome to the help page for <span class="color-light-blue">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
        project management tool.
        Here, we'll provide an overview of what <span class="color-light-blue">Join</span> is, how it can benefit you,
        and how to use it.

      <h2 class="mt-32 subtitle">What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="color-light-blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
        group of dedicated students as part
        of
        their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="color-light-blue">Join</span> leverages
        the principles of kanban to help users
        manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is important to note that <span class="color-light-blue">Join</span> is designed as an educational
        exercise and is not intended for extensive
        business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent
        availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span
          class="color-light-blue">Join</span>.

              represents your project and contains

              these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

              Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the

            <p>
              Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
              permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
